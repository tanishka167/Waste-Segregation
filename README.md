Introduction

•	Conceptualize a project focused on waste segregation, incorporating Arduino technology at its core.

•	Utilize sensors and a servo motor for real-time sorting.

•	Promote hands-on learning in electronics and automation.

•	Encourage student engagement with sophisticated technology.

•	Foster problem-solving and environmental awareness.

Components

1.	Arduino Uno or Nano
2.	Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
3.	Rain sensor
4.	Servo Motor (MG90S)
5.	Jumper Wires
6.	Divided waste box with flipper mechanism
   

Working

1.	Trash Identification: The Ultrasonic sensor discerns trash presence within a defined range.
2.	Moisture Evaluation: The Rain sensor determines the moisture content of the detected trash.
3.	Segregation Automation: The Servo Motor automatically directs trash into appropriate compartments based on moisture evaluation.

Setup

1.	Connect the components as per the schematic.
2.	Upload the given Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.
3.	Ensure the hardware setup includes a divided box for wet and dry waste, with a Servo Motor for automated segregation.
Usage
1.	Power on the Arduino Uno.
2.	Place trash on the rain sensor to initiate the segregation process.
3.	Observe the Servo Motor's movement as it slides the trash.
